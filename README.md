UPbnb is a web application that provides a luxurious house rental service, inspired by Airbnb. 

The frontend of the application is built using React.JS technology and integrated with an existing API.

With UPbnb, users can easily view their upcoming and past reservations, explore a wide range of luxury houses using search filters and other loading options, view a list of their favorite houses grouped by country, and check out individual house details.

To achieve all this, I employed React components and contexts, and used the react-router-dom module to handle page switching and URL parameters. I also made sure that the application looked good by using SCSS style sheets to style the components. And to make it easy for users to come back to their favorite houses, I stored their selections in Local Storage.

Building this project was a lot of fun! I got to use various npm modules and progressively load information from multiple API endpoints. Sharing information between components using contexts was also an interesting challenge.

Overall, I'm proud of the work I did on UPbnb and I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it!
